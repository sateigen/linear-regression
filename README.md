## Signs of Regression

### Description
This project was designed to provide practice using linear regressions with ```scikit-learn```. Three data sets were used in this project: Ground Cricket Chirps, Brain vs Body Weight, and Salary Discrimination.  For each data set, we had to complete the following:
* plot the data
* find the linear regression equation
* find the R<sup>2</sup> score
* determine if the equation is a good fit of the data based on the R<sup>2</sup> score
* make predictions based on the linear regression equation
* draw conclusions based on the data

### Special Instructions
In order to obtain the correct versions of everything needed to run this program, you will have to ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. The two data files you need are included in the repository, the third data set is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file.
